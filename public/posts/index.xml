      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Day in the Life of a Cloud Security Engineer: Mitigating AWS &amp;amp; GitHub Risks with Microsoft Defender for Cloud
Cloud environments are dynamic—and so are their risks. As a security engineer, you&amp;rsquo;re responsible not just for identifying misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, but also for prioritizing, communicating, and fixing them before they become incidents.
